	"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." - Brian Kernighan</p>

			It's difficult to find a needle in a haystack. It's lot more difficult, if the needle is the same color as the haystack.
			It's even more difficult if the haystack-colored needle is wrapped in a invisibility cloak.
			It's even more difficult to find a error in a code, But the excitement of finding the Invisible needle or a  bug makes the search worth it.
			Stop by Bug Hunt @ITrix this year to play hide & seek with the mischievous, camouflaging bugs.
			Get your de-bugging skills sharpened as you chase the bugs through the dense forest of codes. Happy Hunting Folks!
