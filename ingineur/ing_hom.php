	Ideas sure are worthless if they are not executed properly. Most of us have got ideas but never really went out and made something out of it. Let us face it we tend to blame it mostly on the lack resources or just not having time to really work on it. But not anymore,Presenting Ingineur,a two day prototyping event.where people with ideas,have the ability to code and design get together and build a awesome product by the end of two days.We are excited,Are you?
