	Code Freaks is the Coding and Debugging contest of ITrix. The first round contains foxy, intriguing coding questions and those bravehearts who are able to clear it move on to the second round, which is a direct warfare round where you need to debug lengthy lines of code in the system itself. Only a true master in Coding and Debugging will emerge victor. Beware: This contest is not meant for the fainthearts for it is as Larry Wall says &quot;a stroll in the Jurassic Park&quot;!
