		Are you an artist? If not no worries! Virtua Artist is an online event which discovers the latent artist in every one of you.

Submitted posters will be judged and the participant with the most artistic sense will be declared winner. Enter the contest to become the &quot;Leonardo Da Vinci&quot; of the software world.
